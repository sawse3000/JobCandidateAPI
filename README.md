# Job Candidate API

## Overview

This API facilitates the management of job candidates, using email addresses as unique identifiers. It leverages Entity Framework Core for database migrations and updates, and employs the repository pattern for streamlined data access. Note that, for simplicity, no authentication or authorization mechanisms have been implemented.

## Key Assumptions
- **Unique Identifier**: Candidates are uniquely identified by their email addresses.
- **Database Management**: All database migrations and updates are managed using Entity Framework Core.
- **Repository Pattern**: Given the scope of the project, a repository pattern has been implemented with one API and one class.

## Future Enhancements
To further improve the functionality and security of the API, consider the following enhancements:
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Integrate robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination to efficiently handle the retrieval of candidate data, especially as the dataset grows.
- **Enhanced Validation**: Strengthen input validation to ensure data integrity and reliability.
