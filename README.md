# Job Candidate API

## Overview

This API is designed to manage job candidates, with email addresses serving as unique identifiers. The project uses Entity Framework Core for database migrations and updates, and follows the repository pattern for efficient data handling. Note that, for simplicity, there is no authentication or authorization implemented at this stage.

## Assumptions
- **Unique Identifier**: Email is used as the unique identifier for candidates.
- **Database Management**: Database migrations and updates are managed using Entity Framework Core.
- **Simplicity**: No authentication or authorization is implemented.
- **Design Pattern**: The repository pattern is used since there is only one API and one class.

## Potential Improvements
To enhance the API, consider the following improvements:
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Add mechanisms for secure access control.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for efficient candidate data retrieval.
- **Input Validation**: Improve validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

## Resources Used
- **Stack Overflow**: For troubleshooting and finding solutions to specific issues.
- **Microsoft Documentation**: For understanding the .NET stack and Entity Framework Core.
